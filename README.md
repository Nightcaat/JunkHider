# JunkHider

Hides various elements across several GD menus that weren't worth releasing as standalone GD mods.

See the `about.md` in-game for more info.

Hide the "clear search" button. Useful for Android users whose muscle memory hasn't adjusted to 2.2 yet and don't want to clear their search bar.

Hide useless junk on the main level select menu that other mods haven't gotten to yet. [Does not work on macOS.]
![demoTwo](https://github.com/RayDeeUx/JunkHider/blob/main/demoTwo.png)

Hide profile hints, including the ones for social media and levels vs lists. [Compatible with other mods!]
![demoThree](https://github.com/RayDeeUx/JunkHider/blob/main/demoThree.png)

Hide the Newgrounds, Achievements, and Stats buttons from the main menu (individually!).
![demoFour](https://github.com/RayDeeUx/JunkHider/blob/main/demoFour.png)

Hide the redundant white countdown for the next daily/weekly level, as the golden one is persistent. [Relies on "Node IDs" by Geode Team, which is not supported on macOS.]
