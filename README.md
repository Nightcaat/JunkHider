# JunkHider

Hides various elements across several GD menus that weren't worth releasing as standalone GD mods.

See the `about.md` in-game for more info.

Hide the "clear search" button. Useful for Android users whose muscle memory hasn't adjusted to 2.2 yet and don't want to clear their search bar.
